      question: "Will you help us plan?",
      answer: "We will provide a full photo timeline of the day and a family shot list to you prior to a wedding or event so we are on the same page!"
    },
    {
      question: "How do we contact you after booking?",
      answer: "We keep things organized by handling all communication via email until the day of. This ensures everything stays in one place! Once you’re booked, we’ll share our phone number so you can reach us when needed."
    },
    {
      question: "Are you insured?",
      answer: "We’re fully insured and can provide a certificate of insurance to your venue upon request."
    },
    {
      question: "How do you ensure our photos are secure?",
      answer: "We immediately back up your photos to a separate hard drive and the cloud, ensuring they’re safe no matter what. Your memories are priceless, and we take every precaution to protect them!"
    },
    {
      question: "Will you do any heavy retouching?",
      answer: "We believe in capturing authentic beauty so we won’t alter your body or face in any way. Every person is beautiful just as they are! That said, if a temporary blemish pops up (because, hey, life happens!), we’ll take care of it in the edits."
    },
    {
      question: "How do you deliver the final product?",
      answer: "Your photos will be delivered digitally through a secure online gallery. You’ll receive an email with access, and from there, you can download the full gallery, which we highly recommend doing immediately to at least two locations for safekeeping. Your gallery will remain available for one year, but if you'd like to keep it online indefinitely, you’ll have the option to extend it for a small fee."
