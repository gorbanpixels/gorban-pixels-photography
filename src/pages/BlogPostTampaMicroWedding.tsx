    Love vintage charm? The area around the historic Tampa Theatre brings old-world elegance to your photos. While the theater itself may require permits, its surroundings—complete with stunning facades and nostalgic neon—are freely accessible and full of character.
  </p>

  <p className="mb-8">
    If you're drawn to coastal scenery, Bayshore Boulevard offers uninterrupted bay views and lush greenery along one of the longest continuous sidewalks in the world. It’s the perfect place for a peaceful, waterfront ceremony with no cost and all the charm.
  </p>

    Tampa is a city that gives you options—from sleek, modern buildings in Westshore to the colorful, historic streets of Ybor. It’s a dream for couples who want their wedding photos to feel personal, stylish, and full of personality.

    Planning around one of Tampa’s many public events—like festivals or outdoor markets—can add extra fun to your day. Bonus: most of them are free, and they create a vibrant atmosphere your guests will remember.
  </p>

  <h2 className="text-3xl font-light text-gray-900 mb-6">Choose a Photographer Who Knows Tampa</h2>

  <p className="mb-6">
    Working with a local photographer who understands the city can make all the difference. They’ll guide you to the best lighting, help you navigate locations that require permits, and recommend timing to avoid busy areas—making your experience smoother and your photos better.
  </p>

  <p className="mb-8">
    Look for a photographer who offers custom elopement or micro wedding packages. Many are experienced with budget-friendly planning and can help you take full advantage of Tampa’s free or low-cost photo spots, turning even a modest celebration into something stunning.
