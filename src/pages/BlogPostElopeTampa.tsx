          You’ve decided to skip the big traditional wedding and elope in the sunshine and charm of Tampa, Florida—what an exciting choice! Now comes the part where romance meets real-life logistics. Between the paperwork, rules, and planning, things can feel a little overwhelming. This guide is here to help you navigate your Tampa elopement smoothly—keeping it simple, affordable, and most importantly, true to you. We’ll also walk through important photography considerations so you can relive the day for years to come.
        </p>

        <h2 className="text-3xl font-light text-gray-900 mb-6">License</h2>

        <p className="mb-4">
          Let’s start with the legal must-haves. To get married in Tampa, both you and your partner must apply in person together for a marriage license at one of the Hillsborough County Clerk of Court locations. The main office is located at: 800 E. Twiggs Street, Room 101, Tampa, FL 33602 Open Monday–Friday, 8 AM – 5 PM, excluding holidays. Appointments are encouraged and can be made online through the Clerk’s official website. Plan for your visit to take about 30 minutes to an hour.
        </p>

        <p className="mb-4">You may apply up to 60 days before your wedding date.</p>

        <p className="mb-6">
          Each of you has to bring one of the following photo IDs: A driver's license issued in the US, a Federal or State identification card, a passport showing your name and date of birth, or a military ID. If one of you is a non-citizen, an alien registration number, foreign passport, or U.S. Driver's license will qualify.
        </p>

        <ul className="space-y-2 mb-6 list-disc list-inside">
          <li>You will have to provide your Social Security number, but don't need to show your card.</li>
          <li>Both of you will be required to affirm that you've read the Family Law Handbook (which is available online and at the Clerk’s office) prior to obtaining your marriage license.</li>
        </ul>

        <p className="mb-6">
          If either of you has been previously married, you’ll need to state how the marriage ended (divorce, annulment, or death) along with the exact date. You do not need to provide a physical copy of the divorce decree or death certificate.
        </p>

        <div className="bg-gray-50 p-6 rounded-lg mb-8">
          <h3 className="text-xl font-semibold text-gray-900 mb-4">Waiting Periods:</h3>
          <p className="mb-4">
            <strong>Waiting Period (A):</strong> If one or both of you are NOT residents of Florida, you are still required to affirm that you have read the handbook, but you’re not required to take the premarital course or wait. You can walk in, get your license, and marry the same day.
          </p>
          <p className="mb-4">
            <strong>Waiting Period (B):</strong> If BOTH of you ARE Florida residents, you have two options. One is to take a 4-hour premarital course from a registered provider in your county to waive the waiting period, or wait 3 days after receiving your license before you can legally marry.
          </p>
          <p className="mb-4">Marriage license fees vary between $61 - $86 depending on the factors above. $86 without the course and $61 with a certificate of completion for the premarital course. </p>
          <p>Once you have your license, the ceremony must take place within 60 days.</p>

        <h2 className="text-3xl font-light text-gray-900 mb-6">Time of the Year</h2>

        <p className="mb-6">
          Tampa is a stunning place to elope year-round, with each season offering something special. From golden sunsets over the bay to beautiful shaded parks and vibrant downtown streets, Tampa’s diverse backdrops and tropical climate create unforgettable moments no matter the month. Here’s a breakdown of what to expect during each season to help you choose the perfect time for your elopement:
        </p>

        <div className="space-y-8 mb-12">
          <div>
            <h3 className="text-xl font-semibold text-gray-900 mb-3">NOVEMBER THROUGH JANUARY</h3>
            <p className="text-gray-700">
              These cooler months offer a refreshing break from Florida’s usual heat and humidity, creating the perfect setting for outdoor ceremonies or laid back strolls through some of Tampa Bay’s most scenic areas. From the sparkling waterfronts of Clearwater and St. Pete Beach to the charming streets of Dunedin, Safety Harbor, and historic Ybor City, the entire region comes alive with cozy, romantic energy. Festive lights and seasonal events add a wonderful glow, especially during blue hour, just after sunset, making this time of year ideal for capturing warm, atmospheric photos without the usual crowds.
            </p>
          </div>

          <div>
            <h3 className="text-xl font-semibold text-gray-900 mb-3">FEBRUARY THROUGH APRIL</h3>
            <p className="text-gray-700">
              If you prefer mild weather and lower humidity, this is arguably the best season to elope anywhere in the Tampa Bay area. These months bring the most comfortable temperatures for outdoor ceremonies, whether you're exchanging vows on a quiet beach like Fort De Soto, at a waterfront park in Safety Harbor, or on a rooftop venue overlooking downtown Tampa. Just keep in mind that March and April are popular months for local events and weddings, so it’s wise to book your accommodations and vendors early. For the most peaceful experience and softest, most flattering light, sunrise sessions are ideal; especially along the coast or near the bay.
            </p>
          </div>

          <div>
            <h3 className="text-xl font-semibold text-gray-900 mb-3">MAY THROUGH AUGUST</h3>
            <p className="text-gray-700">
              These are the warmest months in Tampa, with higher humidity and afternoon showers being common. But don’t let that deter you. Summer brings long days and gorgeous sunsets around 8 PM, giving you plenty of golden-hour light for dreamy portraits. If you’re planning a beach elopement or outdoor ceremony, late evening is your best bet to beat the heat and capture that glowing sunset magic.
            </p>
          </div>

          <div>
            <h3 className="text-xl font-semibold text-gray-900 mb-3">SEPTEMBER THROUGH NOVEMBER</h3>
            <p className="text-gray-700">
              Fall in the Tampa Bay area is truly stunning, with golden light throughout the day and fewer tourists, making it easier to enjoy serene, tucked-away spots. From the coastal beauty of Fort De Soto and Honeymoon Island to the charming neighborhoods of Gulfport and Hyde Park, the region feels quieter and more intimate, perfect for a relaxed elopement or portrait session. That said, fall also overlaps with peak hurricane season, so it’s smart to have a backup indoor location or flexible timeline. Sunrise ceremonies are typically the safest bet weather wise, offering calm skies, peaceful shorelines, and empty parks that set the stage for dreamy, uninterrupted photos.
            </p>
          </div>
        </div>

        <h2 className="text-3xl font-light text-gray-900 mb-6">Time of the Day</h2>

        <p className="mb-8">
          As far as timing goes, we always recommend 1.5-2 hours before sunset for best lighting. You can also have your photos taken at sunrise for maximum seclusion prior to your ceremony. Additionally, you can choose to break up your elopement day into sunrise portraits, pre-sunset ceremony + sunset portraits.
        </p>
