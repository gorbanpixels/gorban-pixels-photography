              <p className="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-6">
                Traditional weddings in 2025 are all about honoring timeless customs while weaving in personal elements. From meaningful family traditions to heartfelt vows and classic venues, couples are choosing intentional moments that reflect their values and story. It’s less about trends and more about creating something enduring and heartfelt.
              </p>
              <p className="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-6">
                Vintage elopements are becoming more popular than ever, as couples are discovering the beauty of keeping things small, personal, and deeply meaningful. Instead of grand affairs, they’re choosing intimate gatherings with their closest loved ones and seeking out charming locations, think historic landmarks, garden estates, and boutique hotels that offer nostalgic, romantic vibes. It’s all about creating a storybook worthy experience without the unnecessary extras.
              </p>
              <p className="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed">
                Of course, beyond the aesthetic, this trend has sparked a new wave in the wedding world, cinematic style celebrations. This year, couples are moving away from stiff, traditional portraits and leaning into storytelling that feels timeless and emotionally rich. Think soft film tones, vintage textures, and real, heartfelt moments. As someone who adores classic romance and vintage elegance, this shift is everything I love and we're here to help you capture it beautifully.
