As first-timers in front of the camera, we felt totally at ease thanks to their warm energy and creative direction. The sneak peeks within 24 hours were such a thoughtful bonus! But they offer more than just stunning photos and they helped coordinate everything such as décor, florals, makeup, cake, and our officiant. The entire team was amazing. We’d choose them again in a heartbeat."

              <p className="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-6">
                Traditional weddings in 2025 are all about honoring timeless customs while weaving in personal elements. From meaningful family traditions to heartfelt vows and classic venues, couples are choosing intentional moments that reflect their values and story. It’s less about trends and more about creating something enduring and heartfelt.
              </p>
              <p className="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-6">
                Vintage elopements are becoming more popular than ever, as couples are discovering the beauty of keeping things small, personal, and deeply meaningful. Instead of grand affairs, they’re choosing intimate gatherings with their closest loved ones and seeking out charming locations, think historic landmarks, garden estates, and boutique hotels that offer nostalgic, romantic vibes. It’s all about creating a storybook-worthy experience without the unnecessary extras.
              </p>
              <p className="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed">
                Of course, beyond the aesthetic, this trend has sparked a new wave in the wedding world, cinematic-style celebrations. This year, couples are moving away from stiff, traditional portraits and leaning into storytelling that feels timeless and emotionally rich. Think soft film tones, vintage textures, and real, heartfelt moments. As someone who adores classic romance and vintage elegance, this shift is everything I love and we're here to help you capture it beautifully.

              <p className="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-6">
                Cottagecore is rooted in romance, filled with whimsical details and intentional, handmade touches that make everything feel personal and meaningful. Its popularity soared as more couples began prioritizing sustainability (because who wouldn’t want to say “I do” while being kind to the planet?). But beyond that, it’s the dreamy, nostalgic charm that truly captures the hearts of those looking for that soft, romantic atmosphere on their wedding day.

              <p className="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-6">
                Time-honored ceremony elements—like walking down the aisle to live music, exchanging written vows, and incorporating meaningful rituals—are holding strong in 2025. Churches, chapels, and classic outdoor venues remain popular, providing a timeless and reverent setting for the big moment.

              <p className="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed">

                Reception styles are leaning into elegance and intimacy. Think candlelit dinners, live string quartets, carefully curated menus, and classic first dances. Florals are soft and romantic—roses, greenery, and neutral tones—while table settings feature timeless touches like china, crystal, and linen napkins.
